## About

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Yifei, a passionate Computer Systems Technology student at BCIT, graduating in December 2025. With a foundation in Ethnology and a Master's in Digital Humanities from UCL, I bring a multidisciplinary perspective that combines cultural understanding with technical precision. Currently completing my Computer Systems Technology Diploma (Cloud Computing Option) at BCIT, I specialize in software development, automation, and cloud-based system optimization.

I enjoy coding because it challenges me to think creatively while solving real-world problems. Detail-oriented and process-driven, I value efficiency, clear communication, and teamwork. Outside of work, I'm passionate about fitness, music, and travel, which keep me inspired and bring balance to my technical pursuits.
